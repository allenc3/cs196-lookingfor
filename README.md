Looking For - Android app built for CS196 Fall 17. 
  Looking For is an app designed for finding people to attend user-created events.
  
User support
  Both email and phone login are supported.
  
Using the App
  Once you register an account, proceed to the "settings" page to customize your profile so others can recognize who you are!
  You can then create an event through the "create event" page; you can specify when and where your event is going to be hosted and fit it with a picture and a description.
  Searching for other events is easy; you can either go to the "browse events" page and use the search bar (which convieniently updates results everytime you change the query without you having to exit the page), or use the "quicksearch" function on the main page found by swiping right.
  Have fun with finding people attending your events and finding interesting events for you to attend!
